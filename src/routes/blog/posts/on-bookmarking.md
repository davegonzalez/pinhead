I’ve spent way too much time investigating a better approach to organizing and keeping bookmarks. I’ve gone through the traditional browser bookmarking system (too stuck in one environment), pinboard (nice and simple, but so drab to actually look at), raindrop.io (sometimes too much to look at), or even an organized notes file (I end up forgetting it exists).

So what to do in this case? Build my own. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
